We also set the seed to ensure some level of reproducibility, but because of the way CutMix works setting the seed always resulted in the same cut, so we weren't able to set the seed and it will still give different Cuts with the same images. Instead we provide the augmented dataset for reproducing our results, and in order to compare model performance individually.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside `create_datasets()` we duplicate our dataset in order to apply CutMix, we then apply `resize_augment_image` defined in preprocess_common.py which applies the resizing and crops for each model as each model excels at a certain input size [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86340-1_11). We apply our data augmentation only once in order to reduce computation but it also enhances model invariance and equivariance. We then apply color jitter to improve model robustness to different types of AI images with different color preferences.\n",
